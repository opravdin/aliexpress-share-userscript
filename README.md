# Aliexpress noUTM share button
Finally adds share button on Aliexpress without annoying query params and without lo-o-ong SEO-friendly item name in URL

## Where?
Under the item name, near product rating and orders counter

## Config?
You can customize anything you want. Btw, uncomment 17ish line to make script copy localized URL (like ru.aliexpress.com instead of global aliexpress.com) or replace text constant to make your own brand-new share button
